### How I built this project

The landing page is implemented following a mobile-first approach.

#### The HTML

I started by structuring the page with semantic and accessible HTML.

#### Working on the CSS: matching the design

This project includes wavy decorative patterns and a hero image. Some of these elements overflowing their parent element, others being contained within them. Added to that, their visibility changes according to the viewport's size.

Hence depending on the element and the screen width, I either added the images directly in HTML or through CSS.

This allowed me to reduce the amount of JavaScript needed to complete the project.

#### Minimal JavaScript

The JavaScript toggles the `.mobile-menu-open` class on mobile.
